# Interactive Font End Development Milestone Project
This an online cookbook that is made for people who like to live a healthy lifestyle but don't necessarly want to eat brocolli and boiled chikcen every day.
The recipes are made out of alternatives like stevia instead of sugar, olive oil instead of other less heamthy oils, nuts, seeds and many other ingredients are used to replace the traditional ones,
enjoy!

# UX
The design of the website is simple and it is straight forward how to use it. It is responsive and it has been developed with the end user in mind. The navigation has bg image and the text is slightly grey.
Some of the text in the navabr is also white. The same bg image has been used on the footer and forms just to keep it clean. The home page has a background color of seashell, which is slightly 
different from white. Text throughout the website is black and items have a nice hover effect on all pages. The text is aligned left when above 768px and aligned in the middle below that point.
